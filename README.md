EarthPail
=========
### Humans suck at recycling. Robots can help!

The EarthPail is an Arduino-based system to be embedded in a trash can that tilts a platform to drop items placed inside one at a time in the appropriate removable bin, recycling or trash, based on weight. It will be finished by June 2015 on a budget of less than $100.
